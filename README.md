# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of your software}
This program prints words onto the terminal that says "Hello World!" and on the next line says "Have a fantastic day!" . 

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
I wanted to mess around to see how I can add spacing in between the printed phrases so that it wouldn't look so clumpted together. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used visual studio code on my Windows 10 laptop. 

{Describe the programming language that you used}
I used python which is an object oriented language that allows us to do a lot of different things. It dosen't have a specific purpose, but otherwise can be used for a lot of different things and tends to be easy to understand for the most part.
