# Overview

In this, I was mostly just showing my basic skill in python where I typed "Hello World" then under it put "Have a Fantastic Day!" I mainly did this as a practice to get used to do documentation skills within here. My Goal as a developing software engineer is to be more confident in my own skills, and this is a starting assingment that I can use to get me used to python again. I considered making a class of "print()" but decided against it and just typed print() and left it as simple as it was. I did decide that in the terminal I wanted the words to have space inbetween so I added a lot of "print()" to add whitespace between the two sentences in the terminal. 


The set of instructons that this tells the computer is to prints words onto the terminal that says "Hello World!" and on the next line says "Have a fantastic day!" 


The intent of this software was to create something that could give me some practice in programming to become more confident in my own skills. I created this becuase its a quick easy assingment that goes right back to the basics and shares "Hello" and "have a fantastic day" to the world to who see's this.

# Development Environment


I used Visual Studio Code editor to make this code. I got a  python extention within Visual Studio Code and have gitbash on my laptop on standby if I needed the GitBash terminal at the ready. 


I used python which is an object oriented language that allows us to do a lot of different things. It dosen't have a specific purpose, but otherwise can be used for a lot of different things and tends to be easy to understand for the most part.
